## Overview

Well in this project I am going to recreate the classic Tic Tac Toe Game. This is an exercise from the Javascript Path in The Odin Project where we are learning how to use Factory Functions and Module Patterns with ES6.

## The Challenge

- [ ] Build a basic web-browser tic-tac-toe game
- [ ] Put in practice Factory Functions
- [ ] Use as little code as possible
- [ ] Allow players to make a move on the Gameboard
- [ ] Build the logic for when the game is over
- [ ] Create a display for entering player's names
- [ ] Create a simple AI to make the game much harder

## Key Features

- Play the basic Tic Tac Toe against a computer
- Restart the game whenever the player feels like
- Select the level of difficulty
- Add your name to a winner's board

## My Process

> Thinking like a Programmer is about having fun with problem-solving

### Understand the problem

### Pseudocode

After reading the first chapter of the book "Think like a programmer", I wanted to put in practice that philosophy of "Always have a plan". For this purpose, I spend a few hours researching and thinking about the best way to implement each feature in plain english.

```

```

Obviously, after coding for a while, I had to re-arrange blocks and come up with solutions for a few other problems. Overall, it really helped me with speeding up the workflow.

### Mindmap

<!--
After finishing up the pseudocode method, I thought that some parts were a bit confusing to digest for my current level. That's why I tried to express each solution and function into a simple mindmap. This way I could visualize all the co-relations between variables and organize all of the ideas.

This is the first solution I came up with before any code was written. Even though it was a good start and helped me a lot in visualizing the funcion callings, I had to re-arrange lots of thinks in order to work it out.

### Useful Sources

## Approaches

## Additional Improvements

- [ ] Add motion design to each move on the game board
- [ ] Change background color when difficulty changes
- [ ] Add back-end for storing winner's score
