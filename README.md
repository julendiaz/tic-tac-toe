## Overview

Well in this project I am going to recreate the classic Tic Tac Toe Game. This is an exercise from the Javascript Path in The Odin Project where we are learning how to use Factory Functions and Module Patterns with ES6.

## The Challenge

- [X] Build a basic web-browser tic-tac-toe game
- [X] Put in practice Factory Functions
- [X] Use as little code as possible
- [X] Allow players to make a move on the Gameboard
- [X] Build the logic for when the game is over

## Key Features

ðŸ¤ž Play the basic Tic Tac Toe against a computer

ðŸŽ¯ Restart the game whenever the player feels like

## Additional Improvements

- [ ] Add motion design to each move on the game board 
- [ ] Change background color when difficulty changes 
- [ ] Add back-end for storing winner's score 
- [ ] Create a display for entering player's names 
- [ ] Create a simple AI to make the game much harder
